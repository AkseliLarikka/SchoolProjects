# SchoolProjects
A repository where I copy my school GitLab projects in to.

## Full stack exercise ✔️
Car dealership app mimicking the basic idea of https://www.nettiauto.com/.  
No user authentication etc. as that wasn't a part of the scope of the course.
Working frontend and backend. The "cars" are stored in MongoDB

## Python exercise ✔️
A password generator and strength checker where the user is asked for a length for a password (no shorter than 8 characters!) and a random generator to generate said password.  
Password is then saved as a variable and ChromeDriver is used to access https://howsecureismypassword.net/ to test the strength of the generated password. The answer is read from the HTML-source and pasted to terminal.
